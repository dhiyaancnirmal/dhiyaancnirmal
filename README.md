# Hi, I'm Dhiyaan

I'm an 18-year-old founder and builder.

My core thesis is that AI code generation will eliminate barriers to creation, leading to a cambrian explosion of software. The most important skills are no longer just coding, but Building the Right Product, Finding Your Users, and Growing the Business.

I'm here to build companies.

  <summary><strong>My Viewpoint on the Future of Software</strong></summary>
  
  I believe AI code generation will:
  1.  Eliminate or significantly reduce barriers to creating software.
  2.  Lead to the rapid development of millions of software products.
  3.  Cause Product Building, Consumer Acquiring, and Market Dominating to replace Coding as the most important skills in building a company.
